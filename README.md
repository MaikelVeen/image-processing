# Image Processing

This repository contains code for the assignments of the course 'Augmented Reality' of the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. The assignments are more about image processing than they are about AR, therefore the repo is named Image Processing.

## Contents
The specific assingment can be viewed in the pdf in the root folder. The contents are:

* RGB to YUV conversion
* RGB to greyscale
* YUV to greyscale
* Image scaling using nearest neighbour interpolation
* Image scaling using bilinear interpolation
* Image segmentation using k-means clustering algorithm
* Omnidirectional image unwarping
